# 🕹️ Game Development – Unity Game Project – Fantasy Adventure Prototype

BS.c Computer Science - Game Development Course - Final Project
This repository contains a Unity-based game prototype created as part of my studies in Computer Science. The game is a fantasy-themed third-person experience built using Unity's game engine, with custom-designed levels, characters, and interaction systems.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The game prototype demonstrates the following features:

- ✅ Character movement and camera control
- ✅ NPCs with animation and dialogue systems
- ✅ Pickable weapons and items
- ✅ Interactable objects (e.g., doors, caves, treasure chests)
- ✅ Sample AI behavior using triggers and basic navmesh
- ✅ Modular scenes and asset management

This project was developed using **Unity 2021.3+** and **C# scripting**.

## ⚠️ Missing Files

To reduce the repository size and comply with GitHub limits, **some large binary assets (e.g., `.png`, `.tif` textures)** were excluded from version control.

These files are not essential for reviewing code or logic, but are needed to fully render the game visuals.

> 💡 If you’d like access to the full asset package (including all textures and models), feel free to reach out:

I’ll be happy to provide the missing assets upon request.
